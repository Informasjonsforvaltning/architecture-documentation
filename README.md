# System Architecture Documentation

The purpose of this repository is to ensure a shared understanding of the systemâ€™s structure, functionality, and interactions with its environment. 

And secondly to make collaboration easier, enable version control, and ensure the architecture documentation remains up-to-date.

We use the C4 model to provide a structured approach for describing the system at various levels of abstraction with a consistent set of notations.

## Key Levels of Documentation

We focus on two key levels of abstraction to provide a clear and concise overview of the system:

### System Level
* **Purpose**: Show how the system operates as a whole.
* **Content**: Identify users and external actors interacting with the system. Illustrate how the system integrates and communicates with other systems.

### Container Level
* **Purpose**: Describe the deployable parts of the system. 
* **Content**: Detail the applications, databases, and services that make up the system. Explain how these components interact with each other.
